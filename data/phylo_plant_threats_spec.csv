In Russia, the deforestation for settlements (e.g. holiday homes) and for agriculture, construction of power lines, quarrying, and the collection of this species for trade, pose the biggest threats (I. Illarionova pers. comm. 2010).In Finland, voles are perceived as the main threat. In peak vole years, they can eat over 90% of plants. In 2011, the damage caused by voles was very high and many populations have been badly eaten during winter and spring. However, since the decade that the populations have been monitored, this is the first bad year, and it remains to be seen how the populations recover from the herbivore attack (A. Jäkäläniemi pers. comm. 2011). Although other experts agree that voles affect C. bulbosa, they do not agree that they are posing a threat to the species. Voles eat the leaves but seldom eat the underground part of the orchid and most species survive vole attacks and show an increased production of flowers in the following year (R. Alexandersson pers. comm. 2011).']"

Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land, increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland (Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), artificial flooding of nesting habitats, earlier and more frequent mowing as farmers adapt to earlier springs, spring burning, overgrowing by scrub, land claiming by businesses and developers, the construction of roads and parks, and disturbance by walkers (Tucker and Heath 1994, A. van Dijk in litt. 2005,  A. Mischenko in litt. 2007, Hayhow 2008, Oomen 2008, Holm and Laursen 2009, Kleijn et al. 2010, Kentie et al. 2013). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman et al. 2009). In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to sillage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007). Habitat fragmentation may cause particular problems for this species, which nests in dispersed colonies and sub-colonies as protection against predators and may be unlikely to breed successfully in small areas of habitat. The planned development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill et al. 2007, Masero et al. 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the EU in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield in litt. 2008) which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact are unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species's range (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), and drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994). The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestation of the lowland habitats where they breed (S. Nagy in litt. 2005). Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture and urban expansion. A study in the Netherlands suggests that climate change has driven an advance in agricultural activities to the detriment of this species (Kleijn et al. 2010). Juvenile birds which select good wintering sites also select good breeding sites (Gunnarsson et al. 2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds and slowing the rate of decline. There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk et al. 1998). A recent study shows that recruiters from good quality habitats disperse to low quality habitats that act as sinks and so these individuals are considered 'lost' to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie 2015)."", 'There are no known past, ongoing or future threats to this species.']"

Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. This species is specifically threatened by habitat loss caused by felling of forests.

However, this species\xa0is caught as bycatch in parts of its range but does not appear to be a major threat.', 'Northeast Atlantic Skates are an important component of demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (Holden 1977, ICES 2013). Targeted fisheries that existed in certain areas ceased after localised depletion but this species may still be taken as bycatch in demersal fisheries. It has been listed as a prohibited species since 2009, and therefore it should be discarded, but neither discard levels nor survivorship after release are known. Landings of this skate as reported by France from the North Sea and eastern English Channel are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Similarly, landings reported by Scotland from the North Sea are also very unlikely, and probably refer to Shagreen Skate or Sandy Skate. Improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Mediterranean Sea This skate is a bycatch of the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its Mediterranean range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. The change in characteristics of fisheries operating in the Gulf of Lions provides an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small, low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp). Since then, effort increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp between 1974 and 1987. Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea was since redirected to target small pelagic fish; however, this sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, from which no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles make this species especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other skates (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese et al. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is ~ 20 mm.', 'In the Carpathian Basin, regional threats include habitat destruction (e.g., from stone mines) and abandonment of former agricultural practices (e.g., extensive grazing) (G.

Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors. These are the main threats to the species but their intensity is unknown.']"

This prediction is not applied in this assessment due to the problems associated with applying climate modelling to individual or suits of species. Garden cultivation and human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges in regions like northern Europe, north America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand underline their remarkable ability and plasticity to adapt to new ecological environments (M.

The primary fishing method for this species is factory stern trawlers, which may fish as deep as 1300 m (Cohen\xa0et al.\xa01990). Fisheries on deep-water species, which may be intrinsically vulnerable to exploitation, have developed rapidly and many have been depleted before appropriate management measures were designed/implemented.

In the Northwestern Atlantic, as with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). Most basic biological information was not gathered until 15–25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich et al. 2001). By the early\xa01990s, the fishery in the Northwest Atlantic was no longer commercially viable and came to a halt.\xa0However, in the eastern central Atlantic portion of its range it is not fished as heavily.\xa0 Therefore, this species may be afforded some refuge from over-exploitation in this part of its range.

Targeted fisheries that existed in certain areas ceased after localised depletion but this species may still be taken as bycatch in demersal fisheries. It has been listed as a prohibited species since 2009, and therefore it should be discarded, but neither discard levels nor survivorship after release are known. Landings of this skate as reported by France from the North Sea and eastern English Channel are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Similarly, landings reported by Scotland from the North Sea are also very unlikely, and probably refer to Shagreen Skate or Sandy Skate. Improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Mediterranean Sea This skate is a bycatch of the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its Mediterranean range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. The change in characteristics of fisheries operating in the Gulf of Lions provides an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small, low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp). Since then, effort increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp between 1974 and 1987. Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea was since redirected to target small pelagic fish; however, this sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, from which no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles make this species especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other skates (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese et al. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is ~ 20 mm.', 'In the Carpathian Basin, regional threats include habitat destruction (e.g., from stone mines) and abandonment of former agricultural practices (e.g., extensive grazing) (G.

Most forests (in Sweden and probably also in at least the western parts of the species range) have for long been very much influenced by humans – and there are essentially no 'primary' forests remaining. However, previously (i.e. until the early-mid 20th century) forests were kept semi-open by selective cutting, grazing, and other management practices. These semi-open forests have been common almost since humans invented agriculture and started keeping livestock, and possibly resemble the forest structure influenced by the megafauna during most of the Pleistocene. During the last 50-100 years, forestry management has both changed and declined (with management ceasing in many woodlands and forests), creating even-aged and much more shady forests, and, due to eutrophication, the ground-layer has become more productive. These are the primary changes impacting species such as C. umbellata . For example, the Finnish Environment Institute (2008) consider 70% of forests there to be threatened, with threats noted from forestry activities and clearing for agriculture. Esker forests and heathlands in Finland are reported to be in a deteriorating state, this is probably as a result of changes in forest management practices. This species changed categories from Least Concern to Near Threatened in Finland between 2000 and 2010 (Kalliovirta et al. 2010), and the species is considered Endangered in Norway on the basis of decline in area of occupancy (Kålås et al. 2010).

Most forests (in Sweden and probably also in at least the western parts of the species range) have for long been very much influenced by humans – and there are essentially no 'primary' forests remaining. However, previously (i.e. until the early-mid 20th century) forests were kept semi-open by selective cutting, grazing, and other management practices. These semi-open forests have been common almost since humans invented agriculture and started keeping livestock, and possibly resemble the forest structure influenced by the megafauna during most of the Pleistocene. During the last 50-100 years, forestry management has both changed and declined (with management ceasing in many woodlands and forests), creating even-aged and much more shady forests, and, due to eutrophication, the ground-layer has become more productive. These are the primary changes impacting species such as C. umbellata . For example, the Finnish Environment Institute (2008) consider 70% of forests there to be threatened, with threats noted from forestry activities and clearing for agriculture. Esker forests and heathlands in Finland are reported to be in a deteriorating state, this is probably as a result of changes in forest management practices. This species changed categories from Least Concern to Near Threatened in Finland between 2000 and 2010 (Kalliovirta et al. 2010), and the species is considered Endangered in Norway on the basis of decline in area of occupancy (Kålås et al. 2010). At one former site in Switzerland, dense shading from spruce reforestation is believed to be the cause of extinction (Moser 1999, Moser et al. 2002). It may also be out-competed in some areas, it is noted to be weak competitor against species such as Vaccinium spp. and Picea abies, which are found in similar habitats. In the Carpathian forests, where this species is considered Endangered, threats include intensive logging (especially with clearcut forest management), reforestation with spruce monocultures, development of large ski resorts and tourist centres and motorways (Perzanowski and Jerzy 2001). This species has been found to have a very low resistance to trampling, burning, disturbance and loss of forest cover (Matthews 1994). In parts of middle Europe, widespread pollution by nitrogen emissions from industry have been cited as a cause of decline (M. Scheuerer pers. comm. 2014).

Benthic trawl effort has increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 60 years.Sawback Angelshark has virtually disappeared from most of its former Mediterranean range where its habitat on the outer continental shelf and uppermost slope (30−500 m depth) is subject to intense demersal fisheries, especially off the northern coasts. There is evidence for a dramatic decline in angel sharks from a tuna trap operating in the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea from 1898 to 1922 (Vacchi et al. 2002). This early decline probably marks the beginning of trawling activity in the area. Declines have also been reported off the Balearic Islands. Fishermen in Balearia had a type of fishing net specifically for catching angel sharks called “escatera” (‘escat' meaning angel shark in Catalan), suggesting that they used to be common in the area; now they may be absent from it. Demersal fishing pressure from the shrimp bottom trawl fishery is very high in this area at depths down to ~800 m. Squatina species are prone to local depletion because their low rate of exchange between populations limits the recovery potential of isolated populations such as those around the Balearic Islands.

The species has previously suffered heavy losses from an outbreak of avian cholera (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. There is evidence that the species is experiencing low reproductive success on its Arctic breeding grounds. The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites shows that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (e.g. Hario et al. 2009, Ellermaa et al. 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality. The breeding success of this (and other) species seems to have declined since the mid-1990s, when the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle in the abundance of Arctic rodents collapsed, probably due to climate change. With fewer rodents around, Arctic predators now take a heavier toll on breeding birds every year, instead of only once every 3-4 years. However, the main reason for low breeding productivity seems likely to be connected mainly with skipped breeding, rather than with increased predation pressure, possibly owing to worsened female body condition (A. Kondratyev in litt. 2012). A decline in breeding productivity is supported by unpublished data on the age ratio of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic, which suggest a decline in breeding success by c.75% from prior to 1990 until c. 2000 (J. Bellebaum in litt. 2012). Drastic declines on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 are thought to be connected to the natural cycles of the species, pollution from oil and gas extractions, and pollution from the deposition of nuclear and chemical waste in northern seas (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). In 2006-2007, on the Hatpudirskaya Bay coast (Barents Sea), several thousand dead C. hyemalis were found washed-up on beaches (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012).

However, this species\xa0is caught as bycatch in parts of its range but does not appear to be a major threat.', 'Northeast Atlantic Skates are an important component of demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (Holden 1977, ICES 2013). Targeted fisheries that existed in certain areas ceased after localised depletion but this species may still be taken as bycatch in demersal fisheries. It has been listed as a prohibited species since 2009, and therefore it should be discarded, but neither discard levels nor survivorship after release are known. Landings of this skate as reported by France from the North Sea and eastern English Channel are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Similarly, landings reported by Scotland from the North Sea are also very unlikely, and probably refer to Shagreen Skate or Sandy Skate. Improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Mediterranean Sea This skate is a bycatch of the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its Mediterranean range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. The change in characteristics of fisheries operating in the Gulf of Lions provides an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small, low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp). Since then, effort increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp between 1974 and 1987. Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea was since redirected to target small pelagic fish; however, this sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, from which no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles make this species especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other skates (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese et al. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is ~ 20 mm.', 'In the Carpathian Basin, regional threats include habitat destruction (e.g., from stone mines) and abandonment of former agricultural practices (e.g., extensive grazing) (G. Király pers. comm. 2013).

Alteration of the riparian forest habitat by human activities such as hydraulic engineering, agriculture and urbanisation of floodplain areas is another main threat.

The primary fishing method for this species is factory stern trawlers, which may fish as deep as 1300 m (Cohen\xa0et al.\xa01990). Fisheries on deep-water species, which may be intrinsically vulnerable to exploitation, have developed rapidly and many have been depleted before appropriate management measures were designed/implemented.

In the Northwestern Atlantic, as with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). Most basic biological information was not gathered until 15–25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich et al. 2001). By the early\xa01990s, the fishery in the Northwest Atlantic was no longer commercially viable and came to a halt.\xa0However, in the eastern central Atlantic portion of its range it is not fished as heavily.\xa0 Therefore, this species may be afforded some refuge from over-exploitation in this part of its range.

Yesson and Culham (2006) predicted a distribution decline for the genus in Europe ranging from 47-66% within the next 50 years due to habitat quality degradation arising from climate change, with many species facing the prospect of their local climate changing so much that their current distribution will be outside their current observed climate tolerance. This prediction is not applied in this assessment due to the problems associated with applying climate modelling to individual or suits of species. Garden cultivation and human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges in regions like northern Europe, north America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand underline their remarkable ability and plasticity to adapt to new ecological environments (M. Debussche and J. Thompson pers. comm. 2014). ', 'The species has no known widespread threats, although Kathe et al.

Exploitation from forestry is often a key immediate issue, but equally damaging can be long-term changes towards canopy closure and loss of ancient trees as a result of non- or minimum-intervention management systems which all too often exclude grazing by large herbivores. Fragmentation and increasing isolation of beetle populations are also key factors.\n  The loss of old trees in traditional orchards, either through replacement with younger trees, or through complete destruction of the orchard are a main factor causing a negative impact on this species in the UK; also canopy closure is a threat as this cools the wood mould and slows larval development (K.N.A.

The primary fishing method for this species is factory stern trawlers, which may fish as deep as 1300 m (Cohen\xa0et al.\xa01990). Fisheries on deep-water species, which may be intrinsically vulnerable to exploitation, have developed rapidly and many have been depleted before appropriate management measures were designed/implemented. Additionally, landing statistics that are available may not reflect the scale of recent fishing activity, particularly in waters outside national exclusive economic zones (ICES 2010). This species is reported to reach a maximum size of 100 cm; however, where data are available, reductions in the sizes of landed individuals have been reported from many parts of this species' range (ICES 2010). In the Northwestern Atlantic, as with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). Most basic biological information was not gathered until 15–25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich et al. 2001). By the early\xa01990s, the fishery in the Northwest Atlantic was no longer commercially viable and came to a halt.\xa0However, in the eastern central Atlantic portion of its range it is not fished as heavily.\xa0 Therefore, this species may be afforded some refuge from over-exploitation in this part of its range.

However, this species\xa0is caught as bycatch in parts of its range but does not appear to be a major threat.', 'Northeast Atlantic Skates are an important component of demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (Holden 1977, ICES 2013). Targeted fisheries that existed in certain areas ceased after localised depletion but this species may still be taken as bycatch in demersal fisheries. It has been listed as a prohibited species since 2009, and therefore it should be discarded, but neither discard levels nor survivorship after release are known. Landings of this skate as reported by France from the North Sea and eastern English Channel are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Similarly, landings reported by Scotland from the North Sea are also very unlikely, and probably refer to Shagreen Skate or Sandy Skate. Improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Mediterranean Sea This skate is a bycatch of the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its Mediterranean range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. The change in characteristics of fisheries operating in the Gulf of Lions provides an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small, low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp). Since then, effort increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp between 1974 and 1987. Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea was since redirected to target small pelagic fish; however, this sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, from which no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles make this species especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other skates (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese et al. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is ~ 20 mm.', 'In the Carpathian Basin, regional threats include habitat destruction (e.g., from stone mines) and abandonment of former agricultural practices (e.g., extensive grazing) (G.

The overexploitation of the resource of A. minuta by the fishery or the environmental disturbances negatively affecting recruitment of A. minuta can cause, in the very short-term (i.e. in the next fishing season), the rapid collapse of the stock biomass available to the fishery."", 'The habitat of P. minuta is submitted to numerous anthropogenic threats (drainage, filling in, agriculture, nitrification, overgrazing and urbanization) but also to natural threats bound to the encroachment of perennial competitive plants following the abandonment of previous extensive uses (pools of Roque-Haute in the Hérault, France).', 'It appears to be not threatened at the European level although is clearly declining at the local level in some states.\n\nClearance of scrub along riversides and in old orchards can be a threat to this species; also abandonment of grazing leading to scrub thickening and canopy closure along riverside strips and the loss of old orchards. Tidiness, clearance of bramble around field margins, etc. are also additional threats.']"
