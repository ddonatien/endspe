This plant is therefore assessed as Endangered.', 'European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)\nEU 28 regional assessment:Least Concern (LC)\n\nNecydalis major is widespread in Europe and Russia, less rare in the northern part but very localised in the south. It is probably overlooked to some extent because of its special habits and biology. It develops in dead trunks and branches of larger diameter. It never develops in hollows of living trees. The host tree list is driven by the biology of the fungal hostInonotus radiatus, which prefers alder trees but is capable of decaying the heartwood of several broadleaf tree species and much more rarely conifers. In Europe, this species is assessed as Least Concern since it has a very large geographic range and the population trend is stable. At the EU 28 level, the area of occupancy (AOO) may be higher than 2,000 km²,notwithstandingits rarity in many areas and the probable local extinctions due to the rarefaction of alder, its principal host tree. The species is assessed as Least Concern since it has a large spectrum of host trees and a large distribution. The real population trend should be studied in the EU 28, especially in southern Europe.', 'This species is endemic to Europe, where it is widespread in the western part of the continent. Populations are observed to be declining in parts of its distribution area, and the species is threatened mainly by logging of larger parts of their habitat and afforestation with conifers (which is widespread practice in the economic silviculture). This species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (NT), and investigation in the population size and trends are required.This species has also been assessed at the regional level:European regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT)EU 27 regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT).']"

Maximum size is uncertain but reaches at least 640 cm total length (TL), possibly 756 cm TL, with most adults between 288 and 504 cm TL.

It is presently taken as bycatch in trawl, gillnet and trap fisheries, as well as in Arctic artisanal fisheries.

Fisheries have been regulated from 2003 and current catches are expected to be low enough to allow stock rebuilding. Data are not available for the entire three generation lengths (more than 90 years), but it is assumed that the stock was at virgin biomass prior to exploitation. In the northeastern Atlantic,\xa0fisheries-independent data are only available from west of Scotland, where there has been a 70% decline in spawning stock biomass (SSB) over the past 25 years. Over about the same time, simulated mean exploitable biomass from the Faroes south to the English Channel declined by 50%. Other indications of overexploitation in this species included truncated life history characteristics (e.g., reduced average size) and reduced CPUE (e.g., near the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge). As C. rupestris\xa0was exploited throughout the entire assessment zone, it is inferred that the population has declined by at least 50% over the past three generation lengths. The cause of population decline, overexploitation, is understood to have largely ceased. Only small catches have been permitted in recent years for 2 of the 3 main populations (Skagerrak and mid-Atantic Ridge) and a low harvest rate for the third one (West of the British Isles). Surveys indicate some increase in abundance and biomass since 1998 along the West of Scotland Slope.

The species appears to have undergone declines in Area of Occupancy, Extent of Occurrence and in populations across large parts of its range within Europe, including extirpation from France and Switzerland (despite a reintroduction attempt; M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014), although numerical information was not found for all countries. In Finland its status changed from Least Concern to Near Threatened category between 2000 and 2010 and 70% of the forests here are thought to be threatened. In Sweden it is assessed as Endangered with criteria A2ac. In Germany it is also reported to have suffered very strong declines, and in the Czech Republic at least 90% of the populations recorded have become extinct and those that are extant are declining (Grulich 2012). It is considered Endangered in at least six countries.\n\n\nDespite this it is suspected that the total population and area of occupancy (AOO) in the European region are not very small. For example, although considered Endangered in the entire Carpathians it is reported from at least 17 localities and more than 200 shoots were recorded at one site in Finland (Salmia 2011), and in Sweden the number of mature individuals is estimated to be 15,000 (Artdatabanken 2010). The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the values required for a threatened category under Criterion B and the AOO is also suspected to exceed these values over its range in both the European region and the EU27 member states region.The suspected long lifespan of this species (Lundell 2014) infers that the generation length is also long and that three generations extends over a considerable number of years; for the purposes of this assessment an assumed minimum generation length of fifty years is used, however, further ecological research is required to confirm this value. Over this time there has been considerable loss of habitat quality and extent throughout the European range of this species. Global Forest Change Landsat analysis illustrates considerable losses of forest cover, within the range of this species between 2000 and 2012 alone (Hansen et al. 2013). There have also been changes in forest management, such as declines in active management practices and moves towards densely-planted plantation forests. It has a known sensitivity to disturbance, shading, and competition and the threats to its habitat quality are ongoing. A similar species has been shown to have seed dispersal distances that are very small, making re-colonisation of fragmented forest areas less likely. There are a range of documented declines within Europe and some degree of threat within the majority of European countries within its range.\n\n\nExtrapolating from the known population declines in some areas and the suspected habitat losses it is inferred there has been an overall population reduction sufficient to meet the values needed for a threatened category under criterion A. This inferred population decline is thought to be in the range of 30 to 60% in the last 75-100 years, a period over which significant large-scale changes in forestry practice and extent have occurred in Europe. However, it is difficult to be certain of precise values. It is possible that population declines are at the upper end of this range but the species does occur within some protected areas, where threats are inferred to be minimized and declines lessened, and in addition data from some countries, especially in Eastern parts of the European region, are lacking and further research into the population status is required. It is assessed on these inferences as Vulnerable (A2ac). Surveys and monitoring are needed to confirm the current range, population and habitat status of the species and to detect and enumerate any further declines, and the species should be reassessed when these data become available.', 'Maytenus umbellata is endemic to the Portuguese islands of Madeira and Porto Santo where it occurs in 50 localities with a stable trend. Threats described are urbanisation, disposal of household  waste, construction of roads and tunnels, erosion and landslides but they are unlikely to cause the populations to decline severely in the near future.

The species appears to have undergone declines in Area of Occupancy, Extent of Occurrence and in populations across large parts of its range within Europe, including extirpation from France and Switzerland (despite a reintroduction attempt; M. Jutzi pers. comm. 2014), although numerical information was not found for all countries. In Finland its status changed from Least Concern to Near Threatened category between 2000 and 2010 and 70% of the forests here are thought to be threatened. In Sweden it is assessed as Endangered with criteria A2ac. In Germany it is also reported to have suffered very strong declines, and in the Czech Republic at least 90% of the populations recorded have become extinct and those that are extant are declining (Grulich 2012). It is considered Endangered in at least six countries.\n\n\nDespite this it is suspected that the total population and area of occupancy (AOO) in the European region are not very small. For example, although considered Endangered in the entire Carpathians it is reported from at least 17 localities and more than 200 shoots were recorded at one site in Finland (Salmia 2011), and in Sweden the number of mature individuals is estimated to be 15,000 (Artdatabanken 2010). The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the values required for a threatened category under Criterion B and the AOO is also suspected to exceed these values over its range in both the European region and the EU27 member states region.The suspected long lifespan of this species (Lundell 2014) infers that the generation length is also long and that three generations extends over a considerable number of years; for the purposes of this assessment an assumed minimum generation length of fifty years is used, however, further ecological research is required to confirm this value. Over this time there has been considerable loss of habitat quality and extent throughout the European range of this species. Global Forest Change Landsat analysis illustrates considerable losses of forest cover, within the range of this species between 2000 and 2012 alone (Hansen et al. 2013). There have also been changes in forest management, such as declines in active management practices and moves towards densely-planted plantation forests. It has a known sensitivity to disturbance, shading, and competition and the threats to its habitat quality are ongoing. A similar species has been shown to have seed dispersal distances that are very small, making re-colonisation of fragmented forest areas less likely. There are a range of documented declines within Europe and some degree of threat within the majority of European countries within its range.\n\n\nExtrapolating from the known population declines in some areas and the suspected habitat losses it is inferred there has been an overall population reduction sufficient to meet the values needed for a threatened category under criterion A. This inferred population decline is thought to be in the range of 30 to 60% in the last 75-100 years, a period over which significant large-scale changes in forestry practice and extent have occurred in Europe. However, it is difficult to be certain of precise values. It is possible that population declines are at the upper end of this range but the species does occur within some protected areas, where threats are inferred to be minimized and declines lessened, and in addition data from some countries, especially in Eastern parts of the European region, are lacking and further research into the population status is required. It is assessed on these inferences as Vulnerable (A2ac). Surveys and monitoring are needed to confirm the current range, population and habitat status of the species and to detect and enumerate any further declines, and the species should be reassessed when these data become available.', 'Maytenus umbellata is endemic to the Portuguese islands of Madeira and Porto Santo where it occurs in 50 localities with a stable trend.

Most of this region is now subject to intense fishing. This species is highly catchable from birth onwards. It is the bycatch of benthic trawl, set net and bottom longline fisheries operating through most of its range and habitat. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics and increasing fishing effort and capacity, the abundance of this angel shark has declined significantly over a 50 year period to the point that it appears to have disappeared from large areas of the Mediterranean Sea (and parts of the West African coast). While exact declines have not been quantified in the Mediterranean Sea, this species was caught in only one of 6,366 hauls performed by the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean between 1994 and 1999, and none have been caught in surveys of the Aegean Sea for over a decade. A similar disappearance is suspected in the southern Mediterranean Sea as well. Sawback Angelshark is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered in European waters under criteria\xa0A2bcd on the basis of inferred and suspected declines of at least 80% over three generations (45 years) in the past and the likelihood of continuing declines resulting from fishing pressure.', 'European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC) EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)Based on the wide distribution and lack of threats, this species is assessed as Least Concern.', 'This species is relatively widespread across Europe and there are no threats across its whole range, therefore it is considered to be Least Concern (LC) at both the European level and the level of the 27 member States of the European Union.']"

Fisheries have been regulated from 2003 and current catches are expected to be low enough to allow stock rebuilding. Data are not available for the entire three generation lengths (more than 90 years), but it is assumed that the stock was at virgin biomass prior to exploitation. In the northeastern Atlantic,\xa0fisheries-independent data are only available from west of Scotland, where there has been a 70% decline in spawning stock biomass (SSB) over the past 25 years. Over about the same time, simulated mean exploitable biomass from the Faroes south to the English Channel declined by 50%. Other indications of overexploitation in this species included truncated life history characteristics (e.g., reduced average size) and reduced CPUE (e.g., near the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge). As C. rupestris\xa0was exploited throughout the entire assessment zone, it is inferred that the population has declined by at least 50% over the past three generation lengths. The cause of population decline, overexploitation, is understood to have largely ceased. Only small catches have been permitted in recent years for 2 of the 3 main populations (Skagerrak and mid-Atantic Ridge) and a low harvest rate for the third one (West of the British Isles). Surveys indicate some increase in abundance and biomass since 1998 along the West of Scotland Slope. Therefore,\xa0Coryphaenoides rupestris\xa0is listed as Endangered under Criterion A1bd.\xa0   \xa0', 'European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC) Although not common, this species is relatively widespread in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Eastern Atlantic (primarily Western European) coastal waters, and there are no major known threats to its populations.

Within Europe, it most likely has a discontinuous native range made up of three separate populations: one in the eastern Alps, another in the Carpathian mountains, and a third in European Russia to the east of the Black Sea. It is an important medicinal plant and is collected in the wild for its medicinal properties; in Croatia this collection is quite intense, but is carried out artisanally (it is not reported to have been collected commercially). It is listed as threatened in several countries, but most of these are presumably small populations which appear to be on the edge of its range, and there is no evidence that they are currently declining significantly. Its largest range is in Romania, where there are extensive beech forests in the Siriu Massif which presumably provide substantial habitat. No information is available on the population size or trend. Scopolia carniolica is classified as Least Concern as it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for a threatened category, and the existing threats are unlikely to cause the species’ populations to severely decline in the near future.\n\n\nFurther research on its population size and trends, clarification of its native distribution, and research into potential additional threats would be useful.', 'European regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)EU 27 regional assessment: Least Concern (LC)This species is classed as Least Concern because it is widespread and locally common, however it does show local declines.

Other indications of overexploitation in this species included truncated life history characteristics (e.g., reduced average size) and reduced CPUE (e.g., near the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge). As C. rupestris\xa0was exploited throughout the entire assessment zone, it is inferred that the population has declined by at least 50% over the past three generation lengths. The cause of population decline, overexploitation, is understood to have largely ceased. Only small catches have been permitted in recent years for 2 of the 3 main populations (Skagerrak and mid-Atantic Ridge) and a low harvest rate for the third one (West of the British Isles). Surveys indicate some increase in abundance and biomass since 1998 along the West of Scotland Slope.

The species has an area of occupancy (AOO) of only 12 km²and ten locations have been calculated and it is thus listed as Near Threatened since it is close to qualify as threatened under criterion B. Although the current threats are unlikely to cause this species to disappear from Russia in the immediate future, further habitat protection is advisable.', 'Solea aegyptiaca, as currently accepted,\xa0is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea and is primarily distributed along the North African Mediterranean coast. It appears to be extending its range into the Red Sea. It is found at depths of one to 50 m. The maximum estimated age at maturity is four years. This is a commercially important species and is fished throughout its range. It is taken in commercial trawls and juveniles are taken in beach seine and other near-shore fisheries. There are important fisheries for S. aegyptiaca throughout the Mediterranean, particularly in Egypt, where it is considered over-exploited. Although there is no range-wide population information currently available, there is evidence that this species is heavily exploited in parts of its range, for example reductions in mean size and increased proportions of juveniles in the catch have been observed in Egypt. There are no species-specific landings data available; however, landings of the Common Sole (Solea solea) reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), assumed to be representative of the putative S. aegyptiaca, have steadily increased since 1975. We therefore infer that its population is not presently in decline despite over-exploitation. Solea aegyptiaca\xa0is listed as Least Concern with the caveat that monitoring of the fisheries for S. aegyptiaca\xa0is highly recommended.']"
