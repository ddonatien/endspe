Population declines have been observed in Spain, potentially because of introduced predators.","This species is closely associated with meadows and open oak ( Quercus ) forests, most often in sandy areas. Reproduction and larval development generally takes place in temporary waterbodies (most often stream habitats), occasionally in permanent waterbodies; larval development is relatively long in this species and may last more than one season. The species is not very adaptable.","The main threats are the loss of suitable Mediterranean forest habitat, the introduction of predatory fishes and Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ), and the loss of suitable aquatic habitats through pollution, canal construction, dams, and urbanization. A potential future threat is chytridiomycosis, which has already affected the related Alytes obstetricans in Spain.","It is known to occur in Cabañeros and Doñana National Parks, Spain, and is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, and on Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive. It is protected by national legislation in Spain, and is recorded in a number of national and sub-national Red Data Books. Given the potential future threat of chytridiomycosis this species should be monitored closely.","","","Pedro Beja, Jaime Bosch, Miguel Tejedo, Miguel Lizana, Iñigo Martínez-Solano, Alfredo Salvador, Mario García-París, Ernesto Recuero Gil, Jan Willem Arntzen, Rafael Marquez, Carmen Diaz Paniagua",""

It occurs at altitudes of 700-2,140m asl (Sierra Nevada, Almería).","Populations of this species are very fragmented, many of them confined to isolated mountains and valleys. It is relatively common in the Alcaraz, Segura, and Cazorla mountains, but it is rare in drier mountains (Filabres, Baza, Gádor), where it is associated with springs. Populations in drier areas can consist of only a few adults.","The species is present in pine and oak forests, most often on calciferous substrate, in open, very rocky landscapes. Adults occur in rock fissures and on stones next to water sources. Reproduction and larval development takes place in permanent mountain streams, man-made reservoirs and cattle troughs, and the larvae may take a long time to mature. Almost all known breeding habitats are human-modified water bodies.","The species is threatened by loss of suitable breeding habitat as a result of excessive water withdrawal, droughts, and modernization of agricultural practices leading to the abandonment of cattle troughs and other man-made water sources.

Currently, three species are recognized: D. cervinus, D. hottentotus (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004) and D. omanensis (Bauchot and Bianchi 1984, Amir et al. 2013). However, the Diplodus cervinus complex is in need of taxonomic review (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2014).","No","LC","","","","","","","European Regional Assessment: Least Concern (LC) The species is widespread in warmer waters the Mediterranean, ranges northwards in the Atlantic to the Bay of Biscay, and is also present around Madeira and the Canary Islands. There is evidence that the species distribution in the western Mediterranean has expanded in recent years, possibly as a result of climate change. It is still locally abundant in many areas across its European range, and for this reason has been assessed as Least Concern. However some subpopulations, such as in the Canary Islands, appear to be in danger of recruitment over-fishing, and need to be closely monitored.","Decreasing","This species comprises three sub-species: Diplodus cervinus ssp. cervinus (NE Atlantic and Mediterranean), D. c. hottentotus (SE Atlantic: Angola, South Africa) and D. c. omanensis (Indian Ocean: Oman). In the European region, Diplodus cervinus occurs throughout most of the warmer waters of the Mediterranean except for the Adriatic Sea (Bauchot and Hureau 1990, Louisy 2005) and ranges northwards in the Atlantic to the Bay of Biscay. Also present around Madeira and the Canary Islands. Elsewhere, in the Eastern Atlantic, the species ranges to the Cape Verde Islands, and from Angola to South Africa, and is present in the Indian Ocean (Oman). Diplodus cervinus can occur to 300 m depth but is more common to about 80 m depth (Pajuelo et al. 2003a).In the western Mediterranean, the species was unknown until 1980 but young and adult individuals are now fairly common, possibly due to global warming (Francour et al. 1994).","The species is slow growing and lives for up to 17 years (Pajuelo et al. 2003b). It is one of the most important commercial species in the Canary Islands (Pajuelo et al. 2003a). According to Pajuelo et al. (2003a), in the Canary Islands the exploitation rate indicates that the stock is in danger of over-fishing. The direct effects of fishing on the population result in changes in abundance, with a reduction to 85% of the unexploited equilibrium level. The length at first capture by the commercial fishery is less than the length at maturity. The mean rates of total, natural and fishing mortality are 0.551, 0.215 and 0.336 year−1, respectively. The length at first capture is 183 mm. (Pajuelo et al. 2003a). Length at age was described by the specialized von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞=594 mm, k=0.156 year−1, and t0=−0.188 year), the Schnute growth model (y1=98 mm; y2=565 mm; a=0.131; b=1.158) and the seasonalised von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞=594 mm; k=0.156 year−1; t0=−0.095 year; C=0.639; ts=0.818). A power relationship (a=45.82 and v=1.2414) was estimated between total length and the otolith radius. Back calculated length were similar to those predicted by the growth models. Growth parameters estimated from the back calculated sizes at age were L∞=612 mm; k=0.152 year−1; t0=−0.32 year (Pajuelo et al. 2003b). The exploitation rate indicates that the stock is overfished in the Canary Islands (Pajuelo et al. 2003a). With 58% of the total catch below this length, there is a danger of recruitment over-fishing. In the Gulf of Lyon, the western Mediterranean, the species was unknown until 1980 but young and adult individuals are now fairly common, possibly due to global warming (Francour et al. 1994).","A demersal species that is found in schools. It inhabits areas of rocky substrate, to depths of 300 m, although it is most abundant to depths of 80 m. The reproductive season extends from spring to summer, with a peak in spawning activity around May and June. It is a protogynous hermaphrodite (Pajuelo et al. 2003a). The males generally attain a greater size at maturity (327 mm TL, five years old) than the females (273 mm TL, four years old). Recruitment occurs from October to January, at depths of 0.5-8 m (M. Kara pers. comm. 2008). The generation length of this species has been estimated at around 13 years. In the Canary Islands, this species is a slow growing and a long-lived species, with ages of up to 17 years (Pajuelo et al. 2003a, 2003b). The male : female ratio is in favour of females (1 : 2.16). The recruits are located over rocky substrates with an important algae vegetation forming schools lower than two metres. During the spawning season, schools of adults from three to eight fish are observed. The schools are formed by one large individual and a few moderate size individuals. Mating takes place in small groups formed by one dominant male and a group of several females (polygamy). Moderate size individuals are often observed mixed in large schools (up to 30 individuals) of Diplodus sargus cadenati. Subadults form groups of a few fish (under five individuals) or more commonly mixed groups (>15 individuals) with individuals of species of similar size. Otolith age readings indicate that the population consists of 18 age groups, including a very high proportion of individuals between two and four years old. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for the whole population are: L∞ = 603 mm, k = 0.149 year−1, and t0 = −0.22 year.","The species is reported to be over-fished in the Canarian archipelago (Pajuelo et al. 2003). Given that this species has a relatively slow life history and long generation time, these impacts are thought to pose a significant threat to local populations.","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for the species, however its distribution may cover a number of marine protected areas, including some in the Canary Islands. In one marine reserve in the northwest Mediterranean Sea, there is evidence that this species is more common in the protected area with complete fishing prohibition, than in the surrounding area (Garcia-Rubies and Zabala 1990). This species is being reared in captivity and released in southern Portuguese waters as part of a restocking program (K. Erzini pers. comm. 2008). As there are three distinct disjunct subpopulations of this species, further taxonomic research is needed to determine their status. Monitoring of potentially over-exploited subpopulations, for example around the Canary Islands, is also needed.","The species is harvested throughout its range.","Allen, D.J., Comeros-Raynal, M. & García, M.","Russell, B.","Kara, M."
